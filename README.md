# GPSKalmanFilter

This project implements a 3-axis Kalman filter in Python, designed for applications such as GPS tracking, sensor fusion, or any system requiring filtering of noisy data along three axes. The Kalman filter provides a robust way to estimate the state of a system by minimizing the noise and error in measurements.

## Features

- **3-Axis Filtering**: Efficiently processes data in 3 dimensions (x, y, z).
- **Kalman Filter Algorithm**: Implements the Kalman filter for continuous updating and accurate state estimation.
- **Customizable**: Can be easily adapted for various sensors or different types of data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Numpy

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the Kalman filter, simply import the module and provide the necessary data input (e.g., GPS data, accelerometer, gyroscope):

```python
from GpsKalmanFilter import KalmanFilter

# Example usage
kf = KalmanFilter()
# Add your data update and prediction calls here
```

Make sure to adjust the input data format and Kalman filter parameters to fit your specific application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

cd 3-axis-kalman-filter
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash

```

3. Run your application.
